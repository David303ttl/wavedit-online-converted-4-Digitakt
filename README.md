# wavedit-online-converted-4-Digitakt

Using the dt_scw_chain tool, I converted the WaveEdit banks to be Elektron Digitakt friendly.
The tool converts WaveEdit banks (64 frames of 256 samples at 44.1 kHz) into the required 64 frames of 367 samples at 48 kHz format.

A growing library of free wavetable banks shared by WaveEdit users via the WaveEdit Online tab within the software. All wavetables here are under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication.

Each bank in memory consists of 64 wavetables, in an 8x8 array using 256 fixed-sample-length tables
